This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.3.

## Project Description 

Excited to share my recent fullstack  project! 🎉 Through hands-on experience, I mastered Template-Driven and Reactive Forms, integrated Firebase Authentication for secure login, and developed custom authorization mechanisms with advanced routing strategies. 

🔒 Leveraging Firebase services, I implemented real-time data synchronization with Firestore 🔄, and efficient file storage with Firebase Storage 📁. Overcoming challenges refined my problem-solving skills, particularly in efficiently processing video with FFmpeg 🎞️ and enhancing application robustness with Firebase services. 

🛠️ This project not only enhanced my technical proficiency but also instilled valuable lessons in persistence and innovation. 💡 Eager to collaborate and push the boundaries of frontend development further! Check out the project on GitHub for details. 🚀


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
